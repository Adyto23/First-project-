### Data Wrangling and Cleaning
  
- Overall Data description
- Deleting  columns with unique values: Id, Name 
- Looking for outliers column by column, please see above to more information about the changes
- Dealing with Nan Values for each column
- Checking for correlation with target feature
- checking Hypothesis with the age of 27 and with the mean of artists compared to non artist Occupations

### Data Exploration and Visualization
Used Tableau to visualize the Project data data and ppt for the [presentation][(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uV481vZeN0vXxO3m2vl5otSgrpAx9hq-1uts1mDUKk4/edit#slide=id.g1f9b3e5b7c1_4_75)]

### Hypothesis Testing: 
1. death , famous people project - 

##The null hypothesis (H0): mean age_of_death of singer = 27
##The alternative hypothesis: (H1): age_of_death of singer â‰  27

Used confidence interval and stat, pval in order to reject H0

2. exp.generalinfo - 
##The null hypothesis (H0): the age_of_death of all others is lower or equals to all artists  , in this case we took the mean of 64 of the artists as a limit
##The alternative hypothesis: (H1): the the age_of_death is higher than artists

Used the mean age of artists which was 64 and a DataFrame that contained all rows that Occupations are not artists. 
As before used confidence interval and stat, pval in order to reject H0


## Conclusion

In both Hypotesis Testing H0 was rejected and the age of death was higher than 27 for singers and more than 64 for all other Occupations
